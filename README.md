# ChessGame


This is a simple Chess board game I made in Java


Run the main method in the game controller class to play the game.

Click on one of the pieces and all the valid tiles that the piece can move to will be highlighted in Green.

Then click on one of the highlighted green tiles to move the piece to that tile
